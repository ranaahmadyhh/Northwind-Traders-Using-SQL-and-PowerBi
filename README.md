### 2. **Number of Products in Each Category** 🍹🍏
This visual compares the number of products in different categories and how it correlates with revenue generation:

- The **Beverages** category has a diverse range of products, which drives higher revenue due to variety and consumer choice.
- The **Produce** category, on the other hand, has fewer products and struggles to generate the same level of revenue. The limited selection can restrict consumer options and lower sales performance.

## 💡 Recommendations

Based on the insights gathered from the visuals and data analysis, here are some key recommendations:

1. **Focus on High-Performing Categories**: Continue to invest in the **Dairy** and **Beverages** categories as they consistently outperform other categories. Introducing new products similar to Gorgonzola Telino and expanding the wine selection (like Cote de Blaye) could boost sales.
   
2. **Expand Product Range in Low-Performing Categories**: The **Produce** category could benefit from an increased product range to attract more customers and generate higher revenue. Introducing seasonal or niche produce might help diversify the offerings.
